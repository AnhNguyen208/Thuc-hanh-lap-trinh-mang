We first check if the character is alphanumeric using the isalnum method, which returns true if the given character is an alphanumeric value
 i.e. either lowercase or uppercase alphabets or numbers. Then we check if the character is lowercase, uppercase, or a number using islower, 
 isupper, and isdigit respectively. Accordingly, conversion is processed. Lastly, the encrypted character is added to the text at its position.
